The Family Harvest Program distributes food to low-income families with dependent children at 14 sites in San Mateo County and 27 sites in Santa Clara County. Operation Brown Bag distributes a bag of groceries every week to low-income seniors at 25 sites in San Mateo County and 56 in Santa Clara County.
